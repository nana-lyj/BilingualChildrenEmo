1	“我们过得多么快乐幸福啊！ ”他们互相告慰道。	0
2	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	2
3	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
4	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
5	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
6	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
7	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
8	He was very much admired indeed.	4
9	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
10	But the Tree shook its head.	1
11	你一脸幸福哪。	0
12	但是树林的美对他却没有一点好处，因为不管他走到哪里，刺儿都会马上从地里疯长出来,拦住他的去路，那些可恶的尊麻刺伤他,蓟也用浑身大刺扎他，他可遭了大罪了。	3
13	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
14	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year."	1
15	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
16	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
17	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
18	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
19	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
20	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
21	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
22	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
23	黑人们抓过他手里的珍珠，又把他推向海中。	3
24	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.'	2
25	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	4
26	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	0
27	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
28	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
29	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
30	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
31	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
32	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说，	2
33	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
34	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	1
35	Upon my word,' said the Miller with anger, 'you are very lazy.	2
36	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
37	“你把我三分之一的仆人都害死了，”她哭叫道，“快给我走吧。	3
38	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
39	I am very glad I have travelled.	0
40	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	1
41	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
42	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
43	快快滚到一边。	2
44	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
45	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
46	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
47	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？	2
48	I have six beautiful daughters.	0
49	野外的鸟儿在树林里飞来飞去，自有它们的自由，	0
50	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
51	寒风从森林刮过来，朝敞开的门吹去,冻得她浑身发抖，她哆哆嗦嗦对他说，你还不快把门关上？	3
52	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.	2
53	年轻的国王端详着这些东西，发现它们很美丽。	0
54	他往镜子里一看，见是他自己的脸,不禁大叫一声醒了过来，耀眼的阳光照进了屋子，花园和游乐园的树上传来鸟儿的鸣叫。	0
55	他伸出手去，紧紧抓住那麻风病人苍白的脚，对他说：“我曾三次对你仁爱相待。	4
56	Charming! charming!	0
57	“我怎么感谢你好呢？”星孩说，“瞧瞧吧！你可是第二次救了我啊。”	4
58	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
59	我们今后怎么养活他呢？她生丈夫的气了。	2
60	“谁竟敢伤害你？”巨人大声责问道，“快告诉我，看我拿上我的大剑，去把他砍了。”	2
61	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
62	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	3
63	I prefer them to stars myself, as you always know when they are going to appear, and they are as delightful as my own flute-playing.	0
64	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
65	But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before, and the Giant felt very sad.	1
66	闲人莫入，违者法办。	3
67	谁知道小东西会不会给咱家带来坏运气？	3
68	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	1
69	I am a very remarkable Rocket, and come of remarkable parents.	0
70	This is magnificent, cried the Rocket, "they are going to let me off in broad day-light, so that every one can see me."	0
71	What a terrible misfortune! 	3
72	第二天，魔术师来到他跟前，说:“今天你要是不把那块黄金给我带来，那我肯定要把你当奴隶使唤，抽你三百鞭子。”	3
73	Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, "but you are more beautiful than your picture", and the little Princess blushed.	4
74	“我看春天终于来了。”巨人说，他从床上跳下，往外张望。	0
75	朝臣这下全乐了，有人索性冲他大声喊：“陛下，人民在等待自己的国王，你却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒火顿生，说：“他为我们国家带来耻辱,不配做我们的一国之君。”	2
76	What a success I am!	0
77	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
78	一些憔悴的妇女围着一张桌子做针线活儿。	1
79	星孩听了这话又一次对他大发慈悲，把那块红色的金子白送了他，说：“你比我更需要它。”	4
80	At that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if something had broken.	1
81	“胡扯！”狼嗥嗥叫道。	2
82	She is like a white rose! they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.	0
83	It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.	0
84	再往远处,在一片果园里，一只夜莺在欢唱。	0
85	“无上荣耀呀！”全体朝臣纷纷道贺说。	0
86	She thinks merely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.	2
87	多么可怕的灾难！	3
88	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
89	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
90	这花儿美极了，准保有一个长长的拉丁名字。”他探下身子把玫瑰花儿摘掉了。	0
91	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
92	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
93	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
94	我上一次见到他们,他们还在争吵昵。	2
95	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
96	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
97	这下我能写完我的剧本了，他看上去相当幸福。	0
98	他亲吻过快乐王子的嘴唇，掉在王子脚下死去了。	1
99	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	1
100	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。	0
101	她没有穿鞋，没有穿袜子，还光着小脑袋。	1
102	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.	1
103	这可是世间最红的玫瑰。	0
104	“国王的儿子真叫走运，”他说，“他结婚的那天我正好被燃放。	0
105	我这下把风头岀尽了！	0
106	And the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the eastern sky.	0
107	Even the cattle of the field praise Him.	0
108	他浑身贴满了一片片赤金叶子，眼睛含着两颗晶莹的蓝宝石，佩剑的剑柄上镶嵌了一颗大红宝石，闪闪发光。	0
109	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
110	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.	3
111	真正的爱是受熬煎，是沉默无语。	1
112	“你挑选对了，”上帝说，“因为在我的乐园里，这只小鸟会永远唱下去，而在我的金子城市里，快乐王子会赞美我的。”	0
113	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?	2
114	Hans, I am surprised at you,' said the Miller, friendship never forgets.	4
115	王子和公主领衔起舞。	0
116	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
117	“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你一定要飞往埃及去。”	1
118	比如说，新娘和新郎这么年轻就彼此相爱了。	4
119	尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	1
120	“这是再自私不过的理由，”火箭生气地说。	2
121	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
122	Who is there who careth for us?	2
123	可是夜莺明白这位大学生的苦衷，呆在栎树丛里一声不吭，默想着爱情的秘密所在。	1
124	And the Mole answered, Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
125	'Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,' she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.	4
126	嗖！嗖！转轮焰火一圈又一圈地旋转着。	0
