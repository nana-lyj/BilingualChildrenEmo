1	Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring- time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. 	0
2	他顿时感到一阵巨大的恐惧，他跟织工说：“你在织什么样的长袍？”	3
3	那天下午孩子们跑进来时，发现巨人躺在那棵树下死了，身上盖满了白色的鲜花。	1
4	黑人们彼此交谈着，开始为一串明晃晃的珠子争吵起来。	2
5	And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms.	1
6	But the Catherine Wheel shook her head.	1
7	快乐王子的眼睛里唸满了泪水，泪水正顺着他那金脸颊往下流呢。	1
8	“你是谁？”巨人问道，一种莫名的恐惧传遍他全身，他在小男孩儿面前跪下了。	3
9	The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.	3
10	“哎呀！我的儿，”她哭叫道，“我走之前你不吻我吗？	1
11	一尊用青铜铸就的那喀索斯国雕像笑容满面，将一面打磨得亮提提的镜子举过头顶。	0
12	The Prince and Princess were leading the dance.	0
13	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, "but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
14	It is quite evident that you have always lived in the country, answered the Rocket, "otherwise you would know who I am.	2
15	But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light were quite indignant, and kept saying, "Humbug! humbug!" at the top of their voices.	2
16	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest."	3
17	Terribly cold it certainly was.	3
18	Surely Love is a wonderful thing.	4
19	Quite dead, whispered the Catherine Wheel, and she went off to sleep.	1
20	可是守城的士兵把手里的矛枪往城门口一横,对他粗鲁地说：“你到城里有什么事？”	2
21	It was really only a little linnet singing outside his window, but it was so long since he had heard a bird sing in his garden that it seemed to him to be the most beautiful music in the world.	0
22	'Thou art mad to say so,' cried the Star–Child angrily. 	2
23	He was dressed in grey, and his breath was like ice.	1
24	Every afternoon, when school was over, the children came and played with the Giant.	0
25	“我有许多美丽的花儿，”他说，“可是孩子们才是所有花中最美丽的花朵啊。”	0
26	星孩跟他说：“我口袋里只有一块黄金，可我要是不把它带给我的主人，那他就会打我，把我当奴隶养。”	3
27	The Prince and Princess would never be happy again, their whole married life would be spoiled; and as for the King, I know he would not get over it.	1
28	乞丐在城市里行乞，和狗一样捡食吃。	1
29	I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour.	0
30	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，“这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
31	星孩对他说：“我没有带来。”	1
32	到了第三天，魔术师又来找他，说：“今天你要是给我把那块红金子帯来，我就给你自由，但要是你带不来，看我不把你杀了。”	3
33	Hallo! he cried, "what a bad rocket!" and he threw him over the wall into the ditch.	2
34	“我们的老板！”织工恶狠狠地大声说。	2
35	My mother was the most celebrated Catherine Wheel of her day, and was renowned for her graceful dancing.	4
36	Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.	4
37	He did, though, for he was of a kindly disposition, and he made a most brilliant descent in a shower of golden rain.	0
38	Downstairs ran the Giant in great joy, and out into the garden. 	0
39	Well, really, exclaimed a small Fire-balloon, why not? It is a most joyful occasion.	0
40	It's quite clear that they love each other, said the little Page, "as clear as crystal!" and the King doubled his salary a second time.	0
41	He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.	4
42	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
43	You are a very irritating person," said the Rocket, "and very illbred.	2
44	后来，潜水者最后一次从水中上来,他带上来的那颗珍珠比所有的霍尔木兹回的珍珠还漂亮，它像满月那样有模有样,比晨星还耀眼。	0
45	他们只好到大路上玩耍，可是路上灰尘太多，而且到处都是粗糙的石头，他们一点也不喜欢在路上玩。	1
46	There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.	3
47	他到处寻找，却总找不到魔术师说的那块白金，找啊找啊，从早上找到中午，从中午找到夕阳西下。	1
48	有一次他们陷进了深雪坑,挣脱出来就像正在磨面的磨工那样子白了；有一次他们滑进了池水结冰的光滑冰面上，他们的柴火摔散了捆，他们只好把柴火捡起来，重捆在一起；又有一次他们以为迷了路，心下害怕得要命，因为他们知道雪对任何睡在它们怀里的人都毫不留情。	3
49	“呜呜呜！”狼嗥叫着，两条后腿夹着尾巴慢吞吞地在灌木丛里穿行，“这真是冻死人的鬼天气。	2
50	It was certainly a magnificent display.	0
51	然而春天一直没有来，夏季也一直不来。	1
52	“不死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
53	年轻的国王眼里充满泪水，他在人们的窃窃私语中走过，那小侍从心下害怕,离开了他。	3
54	What a remarkable phenomenon, said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.	0
55	巨人最爱那小男孩儿，因为小男孩儿亲吻过他。	4
56	“别这样，上帝连麻雀都关心，给它们吃的呢。”他回答说。	4
57	The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver. 	0
58	The poor children had now nowhere to play.	1
59	“你们在这里干什么？”他喊叫道,声音很霸道，孩子们赶紧跑散了。	2
60	然而他就是追不上她；那些住在路边的人却一直否认他们见过她,或者长相像她的人，他们都拿他的悲哀寻开心。	1
61	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，不过这也不出我所料。	2
62	“喂，你笑什么？”火箭问道，“我可没有笑。”	2
63	他不准许任何人虐待鸟儿和野兽，而是教人懂得爱、亲情和仁慈；他向穷人发放面包，向衣不蔽体的人发放衣服，在他的国土上，到处一片祥和富足的景象。	4
64	星孩十分心痛兔子，就把它放了，并对它说：“我自己虽然是一个奴隶，我却要让你获得自由。”	4
65	跟我走吧,我的儿子，我需要你的爰哪。	4
66	但是那麻风病人看他来了,跑上去迎住他，跪下来大声说：“给我一点儿钱花吧，要不我就饿死了。”	1
67	玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺朝那刺儿靠近再靠近。	3
68	野猪在山谷里拱吃玉米的根，狐狸咬断山间的葡萄藤。	3
69	我什么都不会给你的她喃喃地说。	1
70	但是，瞧！他走过城门时，卫兵们点头哈腰向他行礼，说：“我们的君主多么美啊！”一群市民追随在他身后，大声嚷叫说：“这全世界都没有这么美的人啊！”	0
71	Then the Hail stopped dancing over his head, and the North Wind ceased roaring, and a delicious perfume came to him through the open casement.	0
72	那是第二天就要举行加冕典礼的那天夜晚，年轻的国王独自坐在他的美丽的宫室里。	0
73	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水。	1
74	He was wrapped in furs, and he roared all day about the garden, and blew the chimney- pots down.	2
75	The birds did not care to sing in it as there were no children, and the trees forgot to blossom.	1
76	微弱的日光从格子窗户映照进来，他借光看见一个个瘦削的织工们在织机前埋头忙活。	1
77	人们在十二点钟去市场时，发现巨人在他们见过的最美丽的花园里和孩子们玩耍。	0
78	但是谁都不敢看他的脸，只因他的脸像天使的圣容。	4
79	Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?	3
80	Indeed, I took the chair at a meeting some time ago, and we passed resolutions condemning everything that we did not like.	2
81	The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads. 	2
82	Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature.	3
83	他立即进了门，把那孩子塞进她的怀里；她亲过孩子，把他放在他们家最小的孩子躺着的小床上。	4
84	There is a way, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
85	但是焰火筒和信号焰火都非常生气,他们不停地说：“蒙人！蒙人！”声音大得不能再大了。	2
86	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：“母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
87	“你们俩不能躺在这里。”巡警厉声喝道，两个小男孩儿只好走进了雨中。	2
88	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
89	He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.	1
90	他走得很近时，他的脸色因为生气变得通红，他说：“是谁竟敢伤害你？”	2
91	三年中他就这样在世界上寻找，这世界既没人爱他，也没人怜悯他或对他慈悲,可是这个世界正是他春风得意时为自己创造的啊。	1
92	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：“我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
93	热病在人群中畅行无阻，见人就摸，被她摸过的人全都死掉了。	3
94	Nay! answered the child; "but these are the wounds of Love."	4
95	他的同伴们追随他，因为他漂亮，腿脚快，能跳舞，会吹奏，写曲子。	0
96	Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.	3
97	But the storm grew worse and worse, and the rain fell in torrents, and little Hans could not see where he was going, or keep up with the horse.	3
98	Anybody can say charming things and try to please and to flatter, but a true friend always says unpleasant things, and does not mind giving pain.	4
99	And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort.	4
100	我要去'死神殿'了。	3
101	船长见状哈哈大笑，伸岀手把那颗珍珠拿起来，端详过后，他把珍珠按在额头,鞠了一躬。	0
102	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说：“快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
103	Once a beautiful flower put its head out from the grass, but when it saw the notice-board it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again, and went off to sleep.	1
104	How happy we are here! they cried to each other.	0
105	有谁关心过咱们？	1
106	麻风病人生活在盐泽地里，居住在芦苇茅草屋里，谁都不理他们。	1
107	It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.	3
108	于是夜莺朝那刺儿靠得越来越狠，那刺儿终于扎住了她的心，一阵剧烈的疼痛传遍她的全身。	3
109	印度一些设防的城市里流行饥荒，撤马尔罕的水塘耗干了。	1
110	Really, when I begin to reflect on the importance of my position, I am almost moved to tears.	1
111	The last item on the programme was a grand display of fireworks, to be let off exactly at midnight.	0
112	天气冷得岀奇，连动物和鸟儿都不知道怎样对付下去了。	3
113	And the Star–Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, 'Who art thou to question me what I do?	2
114	He was very much annoyed that he could not get a word in.	2
115	母亲啊，我过去给了你恨。	1
116	And I am so afraid the Pike may meet them.	3
117	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.'	3
118	What a terrible misfortune! 	1
119	一个人从人群里走岀来，恶狠狠地跟他说：老爷，难道你不明白穷人的生活仰仗富人的奢侈吗？	2
120	许多年过去了,巨人年纪很大很大了,身体衰老得不行。	1
121	Who art thou? said the Giant, and a strange awe fell on him, and he knelt before the little child.	3
122	母亲，我当初拒绝了你。	1
123	After he had waited there some time, he sold the sack of flour for a very good price, and then he returned home at once, for he was afraid that if he stopped too late he might meet some robbers on the way.	3
124	“国王的花园算不上世界,你这傻爆筒，”一个大焰火筒说，“世界是一个大得不能再大的地方，你花上三天时间把它看遍就不错了。	2
125	他早先去拜访他的朋友、康沃尔的吃人魔去了，和吃人魔一呆就是七年。	3
126	And the Star–Child answered, 'I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.'	3
127	When he saw her he sank upon one knee, and kissed her hand.	4
128	The bride and bridegroom were to dance the Rose-dance together, and the King had promised to play the flute.	0
129	织工气愤地看着他，说：“你看我干什么？	2
130	他把他那棕色的髯发从额头往后梳理一下,拿起古琵琶，手指在弦上随意弹动。	0
131	高兴起来吧。	0
132	“嗐！”他大声叫道，“好一个哑火箭！”他把他从墙头扔到了阴沟里。	2
133	I will stay with you always, said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince's feet.	4
134	他们一脸饥饿相，瘦弱的手哆嗦个不停。	1
135	But when the Star–Child saw her, he said to his companions, 'See! There sitteth a foul beggar–woman under that fair and green–leaved tree.	2
136	The only people who were pleased were the Snow and the Frost. 	0
137	他穿着漂亮的王服，站立在他们面前，风琴弹岀了乐曲，号手吹响了他们的号角，童子唱起了圣诗。	0
138	他于是走到水井旁，往下看去，瞧呀!他的脸果真像癞蛤蟆的脸，他的身上像蛭蛇一样长满了鳞片。	3
139	And the child smiled on the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, to-day you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise."	0
140	But nobody saw him.	1
141	所以你别哭了。	4
142	我这件皇袍是悲伤的织机织的，是痛苦的苍白的手织的。	1
143	Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us, and they drave him out of the garden.	2
144	年轻的国王想开口说话，可是他的舌头好像粘在他的上顎上,嘴唇怎么也张不开。	3
145	 For if false lips touched it, it grew grey and dull and cloudy.	1
146	最后他对她开了口，话语又生硬又刻薄。	2
147	True love suffers, and is silent.	1
148	树的枝杈全是金色，银闪闪的果子挂在枝头，树下站着他爱恋的那个小男孩儿。	4
149	太阳落山时他只好朝家的方向走去，哭得伤心极了，因为他知道什么命运在等着他。	1
150	Romance is a thing of the past.	1
151	Nonsense! said the Roman Candle.	2
152	Yet did his beauty work him evil, for he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
153	Good-bye a second time; I see my daughters in the distance and the little Frog swam away.	0
154	Poor people, to lose their only son!	1
155	他又抽泣起来，说：母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
156	“办法倒是有的，”玫瑰树回答说,“可是那办法太可怕，我都不敢告诉你。”	3
157	When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars.	0
158	我生养了六个美丽的女儿，我很担心狗鱼碰见她们。	3
159	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
160	If they had lost their only son there would be no use in saying anything more about the matter.	1
161	And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, 'Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.'	4
162	她捶打着她那不育的胸脯,大声哭叫起来。	2
163	奴隶们赤身裸体，只缠着一块破腰布,每个人都用铁链与相邻的人拴在一起。	3
164	就在他转身哭着离去时，一个身穿嵌金花铠甲、头盔上饰有带翅狮的人走了过来，询问那些士兵一心想进城门的人是谁。	1
165	疟疾在广大的人群中畅行无阻，三分之一的人立即倒地身亡。	1
166	“是强盗把你从我怀里夺走，扔下你死掉不管的，”她唠叨说，“但是我一看见你就认出来了，我也认出这两件东西了，就是这金丝斗篷和琥珀项链。	1
167	瞧这冷风一个劲儿往屋里刮，我都冻死了。	3
168	We have certain accomplishments, and that is more than sufficient.	0
169	Death is a great price to pay for a red rose, cried the Nightingale, "and Life is very dear to all.	3
170	And the Linnet answered, Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.	2
171	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.'	4
172	It is so entrancing that everybody lies awake to listen to us.	0
173	我不是你的儿子，用不着听你说三道四。	2
174	And the Giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand, and put him up into the tree.	4
175	Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married."	0
176	织工气愤地看着他，说：你看我干什么？	2
177	What are you doing here? he cried in a very gruff voice, and the children ran away.	2
178	“你这下完全瞎了，”他说，“我就一直呆在你身边吧。” 	4
179	Only the little boy did not run, for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the Giant coming.	1
180	For the next three days everybody went about saying, "White rose, Red rose, Red rose, White rose"; and the King gave orders that the Page's salary was to be doubled.	0
181	认识自己的朋友可是非常危险的事情。	3
182	但是他的伙伴回答他说：“不，把一个小娃娃扔在雪地里冻死在这儿，这是作孽啊；尽管我像你一样穷苦，拉家带口,连锅都揭不开了，可是我却要把他带回家,我老婆会照管他的。”	4
183	接着冰雹停止了在头顶砰砰乱跳，北风不再呼呼吼叫,一股扑鼻的香气从开着的窗扉飘到了他跟前。	0
184	No red rose in all my garden! he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears.	1
185	“我们当时过得多么幸福。”他们彼此诉说道。	1
186	It is most gratifying to find oneself so popular.	0
187	樵夫这时在附近一个木料场里砍木头，看见了星孩的所作所为，就跑过来训斥他说：“你真是铁石心肠，一点不知可怜人，这个可怜的女人究竟干了什么坏事惹了你，你这样对待他？”	2
188	你是老几，竟敢给上帝的世界带来痛苦？	2
189	疆鼠回答说：“你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
190	And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?	3
191	据说那个墓穴里还躺着一个人，死者是一个异常英俊美丽的青年，他的双手用绳子反绑着，胸部被捅了很多刀，衣服都被血染红了。	3
192	To–day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.	2
193	他站在了耶稣像前，他的右手和左手都是精美的金制器皿、盛着葡萄酒的圣餐杯和盛着圣油的玻璃杯。	0
194	那确实是一幕让人惊喜的景色。	0
195	我的山谷与你有什么关系，你非赖着不走？快走吧，别再到这里来。	2
196	整整一天他都在呼唤她，太阳西下时他就躺在树叶床上睡觉，鸟儿和野兽都从他身边逃走，因为他们都想起来他心毒手狠，除了癞蛤蟆守在他身边，还有蛭蛇缓缓爬了过去，他孤零零地一个人呆着。	1
197	I should expect my devoted friend to be devoted to me, of course.	4
198	That is a very selfish reason, said the Rocket angrily.	2
199	枯干的刺儿开了花，开出的红玫瑰比红宝石还艳红。	0
200	Of course; I knew I was discussing some interesting subject when I was so rudely interrupted.	2
201	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你又寸待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
202	王后对他说：“这是你曾救助过的你的亲生父亲。”	4
203	他气得满脸通红，对他们说：“我就是国王。”他把他们的矛戟挡到一边，闯了进去。	2
204	这欧洲北部的天气真是吓人。	3
205	他觉得他在一片昏暗的林子里闲荡,上挂满了奇怪的果子和美丽的毒花儿。	3
206	“在战争中，”织工回答说，“强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
207	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, "I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
208	Dost thou seek to slay thine also?	3
209	In fact, she is like most artists, she is all style, without any sincerity.	2
210	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, 'Why art thou watching me?	2
211	巨人悄悄地站在他身后，轻轻地把他拿在手里，放在了树上。	4
212	他真心为他过去的行为感到后悔。	1
213	There is neither society here, nor solitude.	1
214	街上突然传来一阵闹哄哄的喧嚣，那些宫廷大员来势汹汹闯了进来，他们手中的剑已出鞘，盾牌闪着金属的光泽，头上的冠羽摇来晃去。	3
215	但是他的脸惨白如纸，倒在甲板上时，鲜血从耳朵和鼻孔里流了出来。	3
216	但是她并没有消气，反而取笑他，越说气越大，最后哭泣道：“我们的孩子都没有面包吃，我们还养得起别人的孩子吗？	2
217	Little Hans had a great many friends, but the most devoted friend of all was big Hugh the Miller.	4
218	年轻的国王哭了，说：“这些人是谁，他们在寻找什么？”	1
219	那女人就回答他：“我是你的母亲呀。”	4
220	He was so damp with crying that he could not go off at all.	1
221	“一位远比我伟大的人为你加冕了啊！”他高声赞叹着，在年轻的国王面前跪了下来。	0
222	But a second rap came, and then a third, louder than any of the others.	3
223	'Good-bye, little Hans,' said the Miller, as he went up the hill with the plank on his shoulder, and the big basket in his hand.	4
224	Get thee gone.	2
225	“不，”死亡说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就不走。	3
226	Every day for three hours he rattled on the roof of the castle till he broke most of the slates, and then he ran round and round the garden as fast as he could go. 	2
227	人们肃然起敬，纷纷跪了下来，宫廷大员们赶快把剑收进鞘里，俯首称臣，主教的脸顿时变得惨白，双手抖动不止。	3
228	Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: 'We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.	2
229	还不如冻死在树林里好呢，要么让什么野兽撞上咱们，吃了也行啊。	3
230	小松鼠回答说：“你已经把我妈妈杀害了。	2
231	这是一幕可爱的景色，只有花园的一隅还是冬天。	0
232	They used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over, and talk about the beautiful garden inside.	0
233	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant; "tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him."	2
234	但凡能摆脱宫中事务或接见下臣，他就会跑下镶满金色铜狮和明亮斑岩的大阶梯，从一间房子逛到另一间房子，从一道通廊走进另一道通廊，像一个人专心在美中寻找解痛灵,在美中寻找治病秘方。	0
235	然而玫瑰树大声招呼夜莺把那刺顶得更紧些。	3
236	'Alas!' cried the Star–Child, 'I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.'	3
237	Whenever we appear we excite great attention.	0
238	No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.	3
239	TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED	3
240	但是孩子们一看见他，吓得胆战心惊，纷纷逃跑了,花园又变成了冬天。	3
241	巨人欣喜若狂地跑下楼梯，岀了房子冲进花园。	0
242	Then there was a State Banquet, which lasted for five hours.	0
243	他穿着一身灰色服装，他吐出的气跟冰差不多。	1
244	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky."	0
245	星孩回答他们说：“我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
246	星孩回答说：“我在寻找一块藏在这里的黄金，我要是找不到它，我的主人会打我，把我当奴隶使唤的。”	1
247	已经是冬天了，”燕子回答说，这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	3
248	“不！ ”孩子回答说，“这是爱的伤痕呀。”	4
249	“麻雀难道没有在冬天饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不就是冬天吗？”	2
250	I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations.	4
251	那些跑掉的孩子，看出来巨人不再像过去那样坏，又都跑回来，春天也跟着孩子们来了。	0
252	雪往草地盖上了她那巨大的白色斗篷，霜把所有的树都涂上了银色。	0
253	I am not going to stop talking to him merely because he pays no attention.	2
254	But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils. 	3
255	Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.'	3
256	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。”	3
257	Well, good-bye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you."	0
258	”这块土地是自由的，”年轻的国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”	0
259	太阳西下时，他坐在地上哭起来，可就在哭泣时，他从陷阱里救上来的小兔子来到了他的跟前。小兔子跟他说：“你哭什么？	1
260	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说：“他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
261	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，”她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂，	1
262	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:“我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
263	But the Spring never came, nor the Summer. 	1
264	What a pity!	1
265	他们把我赶岀了城门，谁都不管我的死活。	2
266	我们和那些辛辛苦苦为我们劳作的人有什么关系？一个人非得亲眼看见播种的人才可以吃面包吗？一个人非得和踩榨葡萄酒的人交谈过才可以喝葡萄酒吗？	2
267	So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.	3
268	老头儿从缠头布上取下一块花绸布，蒙在星孩的眼睛上，推操着往前面走。	3
269	过了一会儿，她转过身来，看着丈夫,眼里噙满了泪水。	1
270	整个夜晚她都在唱歌，那根刺儿越来越深地戳进了她的胸膛，她的鲜血渐渐离她而去。 	3
271	“要是你真的是我的生身母亲，”他说，“那你还是离去的好，别在这儿让我丢脸，你瞧我原以为我是某颗星星的孩子,而不是一个叫花子的孩子，像你和我说的那样。	2
272	My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I am going for the Doctor.	3
273	“这位穿戴得像一个乞丐的国王在哪里------就是给我们王国带来耻辱的男孩儿？我们一定要杀了他,他根本不配统治我们。”	2
274	“可我就喜欢争论。”火箭说。	2
275	The King's son was going to be married, so there were general rejoicings.	0
276	这片树林从外面看去非常漂亮，好像到处都是欢唱的鸟儿，到处都是温馨的花朵，星孩满心高兴地走了进去。	0
277	狗鱼是一个十足的妖怪，拿她们当早餐吃毫不犹豫。	3
278	百合花比精选的珍珠还白净啊，百合花的茎比银子还纏亮。	0
279	他深为自己插不上嘴感到恼火。	2
280	那棵可怜的树仍然盖满了霜和雪，北风呼呼地吹，在树梢上呜呜地叫。	1
281	星孩回答说：“我没有带来。”	1
282	“快爬上来呀，小男孩儿！” 树说着，尽可能低地垂下了他的树枝，但是小男孩儿太幼小，还是够不着。	1
283	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: 'Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
284	I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless.	1
285	魔术师扑上去，对他一顿狠打，并且用链子把他拴了起来，又投进了地牢里。	2
286	她用翅膀把山谷覆盖上，无一人活了下来。	1
287	因此，快让我们的君主戴上这顶皇冠，拿上这根权杖，以我们国王的公正和慈悲来统治我们吧。”	0
288	她要是给家里带不回一些钱，她父亲会打她的，她在哭泣。	3
289	Good-bye, cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks.	0
290	他们终于脱险，因此高兴得不知怎么才好，哈哈大笑起来，大地在他们看来像一朵银花，月亮则像一朵金花。	0
291	一个样子凶恶的老头儿正好路过，大声吆喝说：“我出这个价买下他。”他把钱付清后，领着星孩进了城。	3
292	苦难在一大早就把我们弄醒，耻辱夜里和我们坐在一起。	1
293	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.	2
294	Indeed, if he is a really true friend he prefers it, for he knows that then he is doing good.	4
295	他们中间的一个对另一个说：“我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
296	He was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree, and he was wandering all round it, crying bitterly.	1
297	”他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
298	他们的小红爪子冻得不轻，可是他们觉得他们有责任对目前的局势采取浪漫的看法。	4
299	狮子伏击商队，吃掉骆驼。	3
300	凶恶的强盗下山抢走小孩,把他们卖给摩尔人。	3
301	In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms.	0
302	And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, "Who hath dared to wound thee?"	2
303	“你说的是实话，”樵夫回答说，“可是我在树林里发现你时对你动了恻隐之心。”	4
304	只有那个小男孩儿没有跑掉，因为他的眼睛里满是泪水，没有看见巨人走了过来。	1
305	随后他开始感到全身上下一阵奇怪的刺痛。	3
306	Now I am going to explode, he cried.	3
307	But nobody heard him, not even the two little boys, for they were sound asleep.	1
308	Then the Spring came, and all over the country there were little blossoms and little birds. 	0
309	What a delightful voice you have! cried the Frog.	0
310	The world is certainly very beautiful, cried a little Squib.	0
311	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, where is my mother?	2
312	'Nonsense!' growled the Wolf.	2
313	'Well, really,' answered the Miller, 'as I have given you my wheelbarrow, I don't think that it is much to ask you for a few flowers.	2
314	Romance is dead, Romance is dead, Romance is dead, she murmured.	1
315	What a silly question! cried the Water-rat.	2
316	You are blind now, he said, "so I will stay with you always."	4
317	多么可怕的灾难！	3
318	And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.	2
319	魔术师于是朝他扑来，打了他一顿，在他面前放了一个空木盘，说：“吃吧。”然后又放了一个空杯子，说：“喝吧。”把他又扔进了地牢里。”	3
320	If they were real crackers they could not be lovelier.	0
321	年轻的国王大叫一声醒来，瞧！他在他自己的寝宫里，透过窗户他看见一轮蜜黄色明月悬在暗淡的天空。	3
322	但是他们不让进，还用他们的长矛刺他。	2
323	星孩一看她走了，心下欢喜，赶紧去找他可以一起玩耍的小伙伴去了。	0
324	It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls.	0
325	今天你去给我把那块白金拿来,要是你拿不来，那我准会让你挨上一百鞭子。	2
326	 I shall never get over it.	1
327	你母亲没有住在这个城里。	1
328	可是星孩说：不，只怪我对我母亲冷酷无情，这种灾难就是对我的惩罚。	1
329	帆船船长立即拿起一张彩色弓，射中了其中一个人的喉咙。	3
330	The bride and bridegroom, for instance, love each other very dearly.	4
331	请你给我爰吧。	4
332	我永远都对付不了这种事。	3
333	He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold.	0
334	这样，那女人站了起来，向森林走去,哭得伤心极了。	1
335	他看见一幕美不胜收的景致。	0
336	I don't think much of that, said the Duck, "as I cannot see what use it is to any one.	2
337	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
338	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说：“这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
339	“瞰！怎么会呢，”火箭大声嚷道。	2
340	他过去从来没有如此急切地,或说如此狂喜地感受到诸多美丽的东西的魔力和真谛。	0
341	不过是一个大学生罢了。	2
342	疟疾身后升起一股冷雾，一条条水蛇在她身旁乱跑。	3
343	It was a very wild night, and the wind was blowing and roaring round the house so terribly that at first he thought it was merely the storm.	3
344	'I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.' The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument.	2
345	“快使劲靠哪，小夜莺，”玫瑰树喊叫说，“要不然玫瑰花儿还没变红天就亮了。”	3
346	秋天给每一座花园带来了金色的果实,但是巨人的花园却得不到秋天的垂青。	1
347	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说：“你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
348	花园里唯一感到高兴的人是雪和霜。	0
349	红雀儿回答说：“你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
350	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?'	2
351	“用劲顶啊，小夜莺，”玫瑰树叫喊说，“要不然天亮时这朵玫瑰花儿还培育不成呢。”	3
352	The poor tree was still quite covered with frost and snow, and the North Wind was blowing and roaring above it.	1
353	I have no sympathy myself with industry of any kind, least of all with such industries as you seem to recommend.	2
354	As he received no salary at all this was not of much use to him, but it was considered a great honour, and was duly published in the Court Gazette.	0
355	他还很幼小,没法儿爬上树的枝杈，正围着那棵树转啊转啊，哭得伤心极了。	1
356	Of course I should not dream of doing so if I were not your friend.	4
357	I knew I should create a great sensation, gasped the Rocket, and he went out.	0
358	The Prince and Princess sat at the top of the Great Hall and drank out of a cup of clear crystal.	0
359	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: 'The fly is thy brother.	4
360	我们种下玉米，我们的餐桌上却没有吃的。	1
361	他一回来就看见孩子们在花园里玩耍。	0
362	This is a delightful spot, he said, "we must ask the Hail on a visit." 	0
363	He could not play about any more, so he sat in a huge armchair, and watched the children at their games, and admired his garden.	0
364	It certainly was a marvellous sight. 	0
365	他抽搐了一阵儿，接着就一动不动了。	3
366	有一次，一朵美丽的花儿从草地上探出头来，可是一看见那块告示牌，不禁为那些孩子感到十分难过，它把头又缩回地下去，呼呼睡起大觉来。	1
367	傍晚时分他坐了下来，伤心地哭泣；正哭着，那只小兔子又来到他跟前。	1
368	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.'	3
369	我吃了很多苦才找到了你啊。”	1
370	他发沉的眼睑垂了下来，一种少有的消沉一下子支配了他。	1
371	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶哪。”	1
372	“喔，天哪，你竟这般负情。”大学生气愤地说；他把那朵红玫瑰扔向大街,花儿正好掉进臭水沟,一辆马车的轮子从上面辗了过去。	2
373	It was the farthest corner of the garden, and in it was standing a little boy.	1
374	How happy we were there, they said to each other.	1
375	'What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, 'I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
376	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.'	2
377	埃及设防的城市里也流行饥荒，蝗虫是从大荒漠里出来的。	1
378	And the Giant's heart melted as he looked out.	0
379	So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it.	3
380	“啊呀，老公啊！”她嘟哝说，“难道我们自家的孩子还不够多，你非要捡一个弃儿往咱炉边挤吗？	2
381	Only true lovers could drink out of this cup.	4
382	The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir–tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.	3
383	这乐曲在他耳际萦绕，妙不可言，他原以为一定是国王的乐师演奏着曲子走过。	0
384	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, 'Eat,' and an empty cup, and said, 'Drink,' and flung him again into the dungeon.	2
385	这确实令人心碎害怕！	3
386	我们为活着干活儿，他们给我们可怜的工资逼我们去死。	1
387	Suppose, for instance, anything happened to me to-night, what a misfortune that would be for every one!	1
388	She was a Russian Princess, and had driven all the way from Finland in a sledge drawn by six reindeer.	0
389	他一时忘了自己的忧愁，返身跑到那儿，看见一只小兔子掉进了猎人设下的陷阱。	1
390	实际上是你应该多想想我。	4
391	难道你是我们老板派来监视我们的探子吗？	2
392	那个老神父也经常找他去，尽心尽力教他热爱有生命的东西，并对他说：蝇子是你的兄弟。	4
393	“别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	0
394	“我不明白为什么春天这么晚了还不来，”自私的巨人心下思忖，坐在窗前看着他那冰天雪地的花园，“但愿这气候变化变化才好。”	1
395	All day long they played, and in the evening they came to the Giant to bid him good-bye.	0
396	Spring has forgotten this garden, they cried, "so we will live here all the year round."	1
397	And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.	0
398	我们整天为他们卖苦力，他们在金库里堆砌金子，我们的孩子们过早夭折了，我们热爰的那些人的脸变得冷酷而邪恶。	2
399	You must sing to me with your breast against a thorn.	3
400	他老婆开了门，看见她丈夫平安回到身边，便把两条胳膊缠在丈夫脖子上亲吻丈夫，接着从他背上取下那捆柴火，扫掉他靴子上的雪，要他进屋子里来。	0
401	两只苍鹭在船周围飞来飞去。	3
402	可是孩子们说他们并不知道他住在哪里，过去从来也没有见过他；巨人觉得伤心极了。	1
403	但是爱情比生命更可贵，比起人的心，鸟的心又算得了什么？	4
404	她的歌儿越来越细弱，她觉得有什么东西堵住了她的喉咙。	3
405	你给我听着,你这人好无礼,你以为你是谁？	2
406	你就快快离开这里吧，别再让我看见你这张难看的脸。	2
407	But they would not, and pricked him with their spears.	3
408	It is a very dangerous thing to know one's friends.	3
409	How very silly of him not to stay here! said the Rocket.	2
410	他在幻觉中看见自己站立于大教堂高高的祭坛上，身穿华贵的龙袍，他那孩童般的嘴角露出顽皮而持久的微笑,他那黑髏黯林地般的眼睛放射岀明亮的光芒。	0
411	Now I go in for domesticity, and look after my family."	0
412	I tell you what, you are very rude, and, after all, who are you?	2
413	Well, I said Pylotechnic, answered the Rocket, in a severe tone of voice, and the Bengal Light felt so crushed that he began at once to bully the little squibs, in order to show that he was still a person of some importance.	2
414	Any place you love is the world to you, exclaimed a pensive Catherine Wheel, who had been attached to an old deal box in early life, and prided herself on her broken heart.	1
415	Give me rainy weather and a ditch, and I am quite happy.	0
416	Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring- time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit. 	0
417	于是，他轻手轻脚地抱起那孩子，用斗篷把孩子包裹上，免得孩子受冻，然后寻路下山，向村子走去；他的同伴对他的愚蠢行为和好心肠感到很不理解。	4
418	But when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away, and the garden became winter again.	3
419	It is really too dreadful!	3
420	他也打听不到他母亲也就是那个要饭女人的一点消息，尽管他在世界上寻找了三年，也往往好像看见她就在前面的路上走，便呼喊她,在她身后紧追不舍，尖利的石片把他的脚割得血淋淋的。	3
421	枯干的刺儿开了花，开出的红玫瑰比红宝石还艳红，	0
422	这块土地是自由的，年轻的国王说，你不是任何人的奴隶。	0
423	Romance never dies.	4
424	那是一片荒凉的墓地，位于城外。	3
425	小松鼠生活在局杉树洞里，不停地互相蹭鼻子保持暖和,兔子在他们的窝里蜷成一团，根本不敢贸然到窝口来探头探脑。	3
426	他们中间的一个对另一个说：我们这才是空欢喜一场，连一点儿好运气也摊不上，一个小娃娃能让一个人得到什么好处？	1
427	“这位做梦能手在哪里？”他们高声叫道，	2
428	巨人的花园总是冬天，北风、冰雹、霜和雪在树间肆意起舞。	1
429	星孩吃过喝过后，老头儿走了出去，把身后的门锁上，并用铁链子把门拴得牢牢的。	3
430	贫穷从我们不见阳光的小巷溜进来，瞪着饥饿的眼睛；罪恶面无表情地接踵而来。	3
431	And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, 'What robe is this that thou art weaving?'	3
432	来和我一起玩儿吧，我不会取笑你的。	4
433	三个阿拉伯人骑着野毛驴出来，向他们投掷标枪。	3
434	不，你真的是我的小儿子啊，我当时把你生在树林里了，她哭叫着，跪在地上，向星孩伸出她的双臂。	1
435	Well, good-bye, I have enjoyed our conversation very much, I assure you.	0
436	为一个暴君干活儿固然苦，可是干活儿找不到主子更苦啊。	1
437	He flew so high that the people were afraid that he would never come down again.	3
438	你能阻止这些事情发生吗？你愿意和麻风病人同床共寝吗？愿意和乞丐同桌共餐吗？狮子会按你说的做吗？野猪会听从你的命令吗？造成人间苦难的他不比你更精明吗？	2
439	我什么都不会给你的，她喃喃地说。	1
440	在战争中，织工回答说，强者使弱者成为奴隶，而和平年代，富人使穷人成为奴隶。	2
441	海盗在荒芜的海岸劫掠，把渔民的船烧掉，抢走他们的渔网。	3
442	他确实备受仰慕。	4
443	然而等他来到树林外围，他听见灌木丛里传来一声痛苦的尖叫。	1
444	他身后继位的人却以恶治国。	2
445	They were extremely practical, and whenever they objected to anything they called it humbug.	2
446	“不，”兔子回答说，“只不过像你对待我那样，我同样地对待你罢了。”兔子说完一转眼跑走了，星孩就朝城市走去。	4
447	“我在寻找我的母亲，”他回答说,“我求求你放我进去，也许她就在这城里呢。”	4
448	But I like arguments, said the Rocket.	0
449	It is not comfortable here, he remarked, but no doubt it is some fashionable watering-place, and they have sent me away to recruit my health.	1
450	“我这花园哪儿都没有红玫瑰啊！”他感叹说，美丽的眼睛里充满了泪水,	1
451	那女人一看这两样东西就高兴得哭起来，说，他就是我丢在森林里的小儿子呀。	0
452	Who hath dared to wound thee? cried the Giant, tell me, that I may take my big sword and slay him.	2
453	Really, if it had been arranged beforehand, it could not have turned out better for him; but, Princes are always lucky.	0
454	国王说：“这就是你的母亲，你用泪水清洗了她的脚。”	4
455	他愁眉苦脸地离去，把梭子抛进织布机，年轻的国王看见梭子里带着一条金丝。	1
456	No one in the whole world is so sensitive as I am, I am quite sure of that.	4
457	别说了，还是你首先对我大发善心的呀，兔子说完，转眼就跑走了。	4
458	但是那麻风病人苦苦哀求，星孩于是对他起了善心，把黄金送给他了。	4
459	It is what I call selfishness, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature.	2
460	死亡又大笑起来，用手指吹响口哨,一个女人从天而降。	0
461	Here you are laughing and making merry just as if the Prince and Princess had not just been married.	0
462	他又抽泣起来，说，母亲，我的痛苦使我不堪忍受啊。	1
463	You are a very irritating person, said the Rocket, and very illbred.	2
464	星孩回答他们说：我不是什么国王的儿子，只是一个可怜的要饭女人的孩子。	1
465	“唉呀！”星孩叹声气说，“我口袋里只有一块金子，可要是我不把它交给我的主人，他准会打我的，我是他的奴隶。”	3
466	但是，他们转喜为悲，因为他们想起他们家境贫穷，其中一个对另一个说:我们有什么好快乐的？瞧瞧这生活是偏向富人的，不是为我们这等人着想的！	1
467	And when the people were going to market at twelve o'clock, they found the Giant playing with the children in the most beautiful garden they had ever seen.	0
468	一颗非常明亮而美丽的星星从天上掉下来了。	0
469	太阳西下时，他坐在地上哭起来，可就在哭泣时，他从陷阱里救上来的小兔子来到了他的跟前。小兔子跟他说：你哭什么？	1
470	“喟啾！喟啾！喟啾！”绿红雀叽叽咕咕地唠叨着，这大地老人冻死了，他们给她穿戴了一身白衣服准备入殓下葬了。	1
471	他头顶地上的尘土，抽泣不止,诚如一个心痛欲裂的人，对她说：母亲啊，在我春风得意时我不认你。	1
472	我吃了很多苦才找到了你啊。	1
473	My nerves are certainly very much shattered, and I require rest.	3
474	“不”，死亡回答说，“你不给我一粒玉米，我就是不走。”	3
475	他对所有的市民都主持公道，施与慈悲；他把那个邪恶的魔术师驱逐岀去，给那个樵夫和他老伴儿送去许多丰厚的礼物，并且对他们的孩子封官晋爵。	4
476	And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, Why art thou watching me?	2
477	兔子跟他说，你找的那块红金子就在你身后的那个岩洞里。	4
478	My good creature, cried the Rocket in a very haughty tone of voice, I see that you belong to the lower orders.	2
479	星孩脸色通红，十分生气，在地上跺着脚，说，你是谁，敢对我发问？	2
480	It is so beautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name, and he leaned down and plucked it.	4
481	他瘫倒在草地上哭了起来，跟自己说，这肯定是我罪孽深重造成的苦果啊。	1
482	“哎呀！我的儿，”她哭叫道，我走之前你不吻我吗？	1
483	Bang! Bang! answered the Crackers, who were enjoying themselves immensely.	0
484	年轻的国王又低下他的头，祈祷，等完成他的祷告，他站了起来，转过身悲哀地看着他们。	1
485	热病踩过的草都纷纷枯萎了。	1
486	一天早上，巨人醒来躺在床上，这时他听见了一种美妙的乐曲。	0
487	他爱恋自己，夏天里微风不起水波不动时，他常常趴在神父果园的那口井旁，注视井下他自己那张脸的精妙之处，为从自己美貌中获得的愉悦而欢笑。	0
488	“要是你真的是我的生身母亲，”他说，那你还是离去的好，别在这儿让我丢脸，你瞧我原以为我是某颗星星的孩子,而不是一个叫花子的孩子，像你和我说的那样。	2
489	They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time.	0
490	然后他又邀请北风与他们做伴，北风就赶来了。	0
491	那麻风病人看见他来了，站在大路中间，大声嚷叫起来，说，快把那块红金子给我吧，要不我就死定了。	3
492	苍白的病恢恢的孩子们蜷缩在大梁上。	1
493	贪婪一看三分之一的人都死了，心痛得捶胸哭泣。	1
494	But when I think that they might lose their only son, I certainly am very much affected.	1
495	他欣喜若狂，一把抓住它，对兔子说："我为你效了点儿劳，你却成倍地补偿了我；我对你发了点儿善，你还我的有百倍之多啊。”	0
496	And the trees were so glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms, and were waving their arms gently above the children's heads. 	0
497	于是他赶紧跑过去，弯下腰用手去拿，原来是一件金丝织的斗篷，精巧地绣着许多星星，叠了许多折。	0
498	A person who, because he has corns himself, always treads on other people's toes, answered the Roman Candle in a low whisper, and the Cracker nearly exploded with laughter.	0
499	She was like a white rose before, said a young Page to his neighbour, "but she is like a red rose now", and the whole Court was delighted.	0
500	Really it is quite like a croak, and croaking is of course the most musical sound in the world.	0
501	It is one of my greatest pleasures.	0
502	鸟儿落在树上，唱起悦耳的歌儿，孩子们不由得停下游戏聆听鸟儿们歌唱。	0
503	其实只是一只小红雀儿在窗外唱歌，但是因为他很久没有听见鸟儿在他的花园里唱歌，所以他觉得这是人世间最美丽的音乐。	0
504	樵夫和他老婆倒也没有少骂他，总是说：我们对待你从来没有像你对待那些孤苦无助的人那样。	2
505	And the tree broke at once into blossom, and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant's neck, and kissed him.	0
506	他看见星孩来了，赶紧敲响一个木碗，揺起他的铃，向他呼求，说：给我一点儿钱吧，要不我就饿死了。	1
507	I have many beautiful flowers, he said, "but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all."	4
508	It sounded so sweet to his ears that he thought it must be the King's musicians passing by.	0
509	他再也玩儿不动了，只好坐在他的大扶手椅子里，看孩子们玩儿游戏，观赏他自己的花园。	0
510	早上起来时，他从树上采摘了一些苦涩的浆果充饥，又向大森林出发，哭得伤心极了。	1
511	“不必多提，毕竟是你首先心疼我的呀。”兔子说，它转眼就跑走了。	4
512	I often have long conversations all by myself, and I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying.	0
513	北风用皮外衣裹得严严实实，整天都在花园里呜呜叫个不停,把烟囱都刮倒了。	1
514	唯一欢迎这大冷天的好像只有大角猫头鹰。	0
515	尼罗河没有泛滥，祭士们都在诅咒伊西斯回和奥西里斯図。	1
516	然而，他统治的时候不长，因为他过去遭受苦难太多，考验他的烈火太猛，他仅仅活了三年就死去了。	1
517	然而贪婪攥紧手，咬紧牙关。	2
518	When the three days were over the marriage was celebrated.	0
519	鸟儿们到处飞动，高兴得叽叽喳喳鸣叫，花儿从绿草地往上张望，喜笑颜开。	0
520	咸涩的浪花在桨叶中翻飞。	1
521	树们非常高兴孩子们又回来了，便开满了花儿，在孩子们的头上轻轻地摇动起他们的枝杈。	0
522	巨人看着这幕景致，心融化了。	4
523	他高兴得大叫起来，跑了过去，跪下来亲吻他母亲脚上的伤口，眼泪都把伤口打湿了。	0
524	I am laughing because I am happy, replied the Cracker.	0
525	但他的心情却十分沉重，因为他知道什么厄运在等着他。	1
526	Delightful! he cried, I shall go on like this for ever. 	0
527	小男孩儿对巨人微笑着跟他说：“你曾经让我在你的花园里玩耍过，今天你跟我到我的花园去吧，那是天堂。”	0
528	“我身穿痛苦铸就的衣冠，能高兴起来吗？”年轻的国王说。	1
529	红雀儿回答说，你图一时快活，把我的翅膀剪掉了。	2
530	The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks.	1
531	一抹淡淡的茉莉花香从敞开的窗子飘了进来。	0
532	但是那个巨人深爱的小男孩儿再也没有露面。	1
533	 “我什么都不会送给你的。”贪婪说。	1
534	她走得疲惫不堪，就在一棵栗子树下坐下来休息。	1
535	然而星孩呆在原地一动不动，对她完全关上了心扉，除了那女人痛苦的哭泣声外，别的什么也没听到。	1
536	那个老神父也经常找他去，尽心尽力教他热爱有生命的东西，并对他说，蝇子是你的兄弟。	4
537	他疲乏地爬下绳梯，消失在海中。	1
538	“大地就要喜结良缘了，这是她的婚礼服。”斑鸠彼此小声交谈说。	0
539	Ah! the higher things of life, how fine they are! said the Duck; "and that reminds me how hungry I feel": and she swam away down the stream, saying, "Quack, quack, quack."	0
540	每天下午，孩子们从学校出来后，都往往到巨人的花园去玩耍。	0
541	The sledge was shaped like a great golden swan, and between the swan's wings lay the little Princess herself.	0
542	The birds sat on the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them.	0
543	星孩一听这话泪流满面，心下嘀咕道:“他们在嘲笑我，拿我的痛苦寻开心。”	1
544	I never said I knew him, answered the Rocket.	4
545	这时樵夫的小女儿走到他身边，把手搭在他肩上，说，即使你真的失去了你的美貌，那又有什么关系呢？	4
546	我要到水井旁照一照去，井水会照出我的美丽。	0
547	当然,我们之间是有区别的------他穿金戴银而我衣衫褴褛，我饿得要死而他撑得难受。	1
548	小松鼠在杉树上过着孤单的生活，他对小松鼠说：“我的母亲在哪里呢？”	1
549	He was really very sorry for what he had done.	1
550	疼痛越来越厉害，她的歌儿越来越高亢，因为她唱的是用死亡成全的爱情，是不会在坟墓里死去的爱情。	1
551	放学后，他们只好绕着那圈高墙转悠，谈论着墙里那美丽的花园。	1
552	Bitter, bitter was the pain, and wilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is perfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.	1
553	疆鼠回答说：你早把我的眼睛弄瞎了。	2
554	Then the moon rose like a wonderful silver shield, and the stars began to shine, and a sound of music came from the palace.	0
555	You will see them twinkle when I talk to them about the pretty bride.	0
556	爰情确实是一件妙不可言的东西。	4
557	每天下午，学校放学后孩子们都要来和巨人玩耍。	0
558	Years went over, and the Giant grew very old and feeble. 	1
559	Huzza! Huzza! cried the Court, and the little Princess laughed with pleasure.	0
560	The best thing in him was the gunpowder, and that was so wet with tears that it was of no use.	1
561	红玫瑰比红宝石还鲜红啊，玫瑰的叶子就是年殳扁的金子。	0
562	那棵树马上鲜花怒放，鸟儿们纷纷飞来在上面唱歌，小男孩儿伸开他的双臂，紧紧抱住了巨人的脖子，亲吻他。	0
563	但是那麻风病人一言不发。	1
564	树间到处是猿和孔雀。	0
565	And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir–tree, and was lonely, he said, 'Where is my mother?'	0
566	真的就像哇哇地叫唤，哇哇叫唤当然是世上最有音乐感的声音了。	0
567	“哎呀！这种人生观真是太糟了！”火箭说，“不过这也不出我所料。	2
568	His body was found the next day by some goatherds, floating in a great pool of water, and was brought back by them to the cottage.	1
569	苍白的月儿听见了，把黎明忘在脑后，滞留在天空不肯离去。	0
570	“我觉得好凉快，”男孩子说，“我一定好多了。”他很快进入了香甜的梦乡。	0
571	So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.	1
572	王子和公主从此再没有幸福可言，他们的婚姻生活全都蒙上了阴影,至于国王，我知道他简直过不了这关。	1
573	我的臣子都叫我“快乐王子”，而且我也的确很幸福，如果开心就是幸福的话。	0
574	So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.	1
575	“她像一朵白玫瑰！”他们呼叫着，纷纷从阳台上往她身上抛花儿。	0
576	Here indeed is the true lover, said the Nightingale.	4
577	'What a delightful time I shall have in my garden,' he said, and he went to work at once.	0
578	And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in.	4
579	他的头发像风信子花一样乌黑，他的嘴唇像他渴求的玫瑰一样殷红,可是激情使他的脸色白如象牙,忧愁使他的额头紧锁。	1
580	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，她就会和我一直跳到天亮。	0
581	“我是来和你告别的。”他大声说。	1
582	No, answered the Linnet, "I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face.	0
583	Here is the reddest rose in all the world.	0
584	她最初唱的是爱情在少男和少女的心扉萌生。	0
585	这是一场洋洋大观的婚礼，在一顶缀满珍珠的紫色天鹅绒华盖下，新娘和新郎手拉手缓缓走过。	0
586	雪橇的样子像一只金色大天鹅，这位纤巧的公主本人坐在天鹅的翅膀中间。	0
587	“星星有多美啊，”他对她说，“爱情的力量又是多么美妙啊！ ”	4
588	But the Star–Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain.	1
589	And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: Wilt thou not close the door?	3
590	除了非凡的火箭，每一个都表演得非常成功。	0
591	Thy mother dwells not in this city.	1
592	他们的眼睛都像绿宝石，他们的吼叫声比大瀑布的呼啸还响亮呢。	0
593	不过，也得承认，她的声音有时听上去很美。	0
594	But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her, and he flung himself down on the grass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.	1
595	Pale was it, at first, as the mist that hangs over the river—pale as the feet of the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn.	0
596	“这里可不怎么舒服，”他说，不过这里肯定是个时髦的水疗场，他们送我来休养身体的。	1
597	“你的声音可真好听！”青蛙大声说。	0
598	'It has certainly been a hard day,' said little Hans to himself as he was going to bed, 'but I am glad I did not refuse the Miller, for he is my best friend, and, besides, he is going to give me his wheelbarrow.'	4
599	Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the marketplace.	1
600	My roses are yellow, it answered, "as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe.	0
601	栖息在这绿色的林子里,看着太阳乘坐他的金马军，看着月亮乘坐她的银马车，真是一件开心的事啊。	0
602	“我很高兴你终于要去埃及了，小燕子，”王子说，“你在这里呆得够长了,不过你一定要亲亲我的嘴唇，因为我爱你呀。”	4
603	Tell me, canst thou see my mother?	1
604	他的所有穷亲戚他都从来不屑一顾,嗤之以鼻，这时却纷纷冲上天际，在一片片火光中像美妙的金花儿。	0
605	我对你别无所求，只求你做一个痴心情郎，因为爱情远比哲学更智慧------虽然哲学就够智慧了,比权力更强大---虽然权力就够强大了。	4
606	整个夜晚你都必须给我唱歌，那根刺一定会刺进你的心，你的鲜血必须流进我的叶脉里，成为我自己的血。	3
607	“她说过，如果我给她带红玫瑰来，她就和我跳舞。”年轻的大学生嚷嚷说,“可是我的花园里哪儿也没有红玫瑰啊。”	1
608	“瞧，快瞧！”玫瑰树招呼说，“这朵玫瑰终于培育成了。”但是夜莺没有回答，因为她躺在深草丛中，死了，心上带着那根刺儿。	1
609	And the Star–Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, 'I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.'	4
610	Crimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the heart.	0
611	去年夏天，我在河边呆着时,两个野男孩儿，就是磨坊主的儿子，总是用石头砸我。	2
612	炉膛没有火，他饿得有气无力。	1
613	The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air.	0
614	“那你还是不哭的好。”	1
615	The young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left him, and the tears were not yet dry in his beautiful eyes.	1
616	天下的奇闻莫过于苦难。	1
617	But he lives so far away, and it is such a bad night, that it has just occurred to me that it would be much better if you went instead of me.	1
618	Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.	2
619	Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that be would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.	0
620	For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving–kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride.	1
621	But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?	2
622	Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.	1
623	我可是宫廷的大宠儿,实际上，王子和公主昨天就是冲我的面子才举行婚礼的。	0
624	“燕子，燕子，小燕子啊，”王子说，“快按我要求你的去做吧。”	4
625	可是我的花园里没有红玫瑰,那我只好孤零零坐在那里，眼睁睁看她从我身边走过去。	1
626	But the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began to beat, and a film came over her eyes.	1
627	我们只好把它扔掉了。	1
628	Here is the basket, and mind you fill it quite full.	3
629	'How shall I reward thee?' cried the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.'	4
630	Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched.	1
631	但是，它们好像并没有发生多大作用。	1
632	你的画像很美丽，他小声说，“但是你比你的画像还美丽。”娇小的公主一下子脸红了。	0
633	It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl.	0
634	“她刚才还像一朵白玫瑰，”小侍童对身边的人说，“可是她现在一下子成了一朵红玫瑰了。”整个宫廷听了都很高兴。	0
635	那个孩子渴坏了，可他的母亲干着急没办法啊。	1
636	“音乐家们会在他们的乐池里就座，”年轻的大学生说，“弹奏他们的乐器，我的情人儿会随着竖琴和小提琴的乐曲翩翩起舞。她会跳得脚下生风，连地都不沾，那些献殷勤的人穿戴得漂漂亮亮,纷纷围着她打转转。	0
637	“好开心！”他嚷道，我就要这样一直飞上去了。	0
638	Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar–woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.	1
639	And he said to her, 'Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.	1
640	And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.	4
641	小孩儿在发烧，口口声声要橘子吃。	1
642	'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire, 'very thoughtful indeed.	0
643	月亮升上天空时，他飞回到快乐王子身边。	0
644	然而没有人看见他。	1
645	她把火柴掉进臭水沟里，火柴都弄坏了。	1
646	我喜欢听我自己说话。	0
647	And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.	0
648	And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, 'The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred–fold.'	0
649	小燕子于是围着芦苇飞啊，飞啊，用翅膀轻轻触动水面，激起一圈圈银色的涟漪。	0
650	这是我的一大乐趣。	0
651	那朵红玫瑰听见了，狂喜得直哆嗦，向清冷的晨气绽开了花瓣儿。	0
652	“我不是要到埃及去，”燕子说，	1
653	“我和你再呆一个夜晚吧，”燕子说，真的动了恻隐之心。	4
654	In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his.	0
655	Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet–scented flowers, and the Star–Child entered it gladly.	0
656	But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, 'Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.'	1
657	“你当然难受了！”信号焰火叫道。	1
658	“我愿意再和你呆一个夜晚，”燕子说，可是我不忍心啄掉你的眼睛。	1
659	这世界的确非常美丽，一个小爆筒大声说。	0
660	在月亮光下, 他的脸美丽极了,小燕子心里油然升起怜悯之情。	4
661	And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it.	1
662	然后是盛大的国宴，持续了五个小时。	0
663	Yet did his beauty work him evil. For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.	2
664	I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.	2
665	I would much sooner have your good opinion than my silver buttons, any day, and he ran and plucked all his pretty primroses, and filled the Miller's basket.	0
666	那个年轻人两手把头抱得紧紧的,一点没有听见燕子扑棱翅膀的声音，他抬头看时才发现那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在那些枯萎的紫罗兰上面。	0
667	“如果你想要一朵红玫瑰，”玫瑰树说，你必须在月光下用音乐来孕育一朵啊，还必须用你自己的心血来染红它。	4
668	王子有一双朦胧的紫罗兰色眼睛，头发像纯金般金黄。	0
669	于是，燕子啄掉了王子的另一只眼睛,衔着飞走了。	1
670	你没有眼睛什么都看不见啊。	1
671	And the woman answered him, 'I am thy mother.'	4
672	And they said to him, 'It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.'	1
673	'If in very truth thou art my mother,' he said, 'it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.	2
674	她深深叹息了一声，又寻思那个松木盒子。	1
675	His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not.	0
676	But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, Why, where is my mother?	2
677	多么遗憾啊！	1
678	Little Hans was very much distressed at times, as he was afraid his flowers would think he had forgotten them, but he consoled himself by the reflection that the Miller was his best friend.	1
679	“我身上裹着赤金王子说，“你一定把它啄下来，一片一片地啄，把它送给穷人,活着的人总是以为金子能让他幸福。”	0
680	For I see none here but this vile beggar–woman.	1
681	可是他们根本就没有注意他，眼瞅着就要走了。	1
682	But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.	4
683	然后他轻轻地绕着床飞,用翅膀往小男孩儿的脑门儿上扇风。	0
684	During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts.	1
685	我的朋友正在尼罗河上飞来飞去,跟大荷花说话呢。	0
686	What I sing of, he suffers, what is joy to me, to him is pain.	1
687	“好听啊！好听啊！”	0
688	他的双翼是火焰色的，他的身体像火焰一样有色彩。	0
689	Everybody went to little Hans' funeral, as he was so popular, and the Miller was the chief mourner.	1
690	我很高兴我旅行过。	0
691	“不管哪里，只要你爱它，那儿就是你的世界。”	4
692	一个转轮焰火忧心忡忡地说。	1
693	她老早就被缚在了一个旧松木盒子上,颇为她破碎的心感到自豪,“可是爱这东西不再时髦了，全让诗人扼杀了。	1
694	Oh, I am so sorry,' said Hans, but I am really very busy to-day.	1
695	“有人开始赏识我了，”他惊叫道，这一定是某个了不起的崇拜者送来的。	0
696	Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.	4
697	But the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of the little Nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.	1
698	'If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits.'	0
699	在一座桥拱下面，两个小男孩儿紧紧依偎着取暖。	1
700	“我是快乐王子。”	0
701	但是最终他知道他就要死去了。	1
702	于是他们把快乐王子的塑像拉倒了。	1
703	他飞过卖火柴的小女孩儿身旁，他把蓝宝石放在了她的手掌上。	0
704	“为了一朵红玫瑰，要豁上性命，这代价太大了，”夜莺尖声叫道，生命对谁来说都非常宝贵。	1
705	But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star–Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold.	4
706	Love is all very well in its way, but friendship is much higher.	4
707	For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.	1
708	And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.	1
709	我称你这种行为是自私，而自私是顶顶讨厌的玩意儿，尤其我这种脾气受不了，因我生来就富有同情心，谁都知道的。	2
710	“我的玫瑰是黄色的，”玫瑰树回答说，黄得像坐在琥珀御座上的美人鱼的头发，甚至比割草人挥起大镰刀割过的草地中的黄水仙还鲜黄。	0
711	Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, 'Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?	1
712	王子和公主坐在大厅的首席，喝干了一水晶杯酒。	0
713	“我的玫瑰是红色的，”玫瑰树回答说，红得像鸽子的爪子，甚至比海洋深洞里的珊瑚大扇叶还要红。	0
714	第二天一整天他都落在王子的肩膀上，跟王子讲他在异国他乡经历的事情。	0
715	“这是因为你干了一件好事啊。”王子说。	0
716	“我活着时，曾有一颗常人的心。塑像回答说，我那时不知道泪水是什么，因为我生在逍遥宫里，忧愁是没法进那里的。	1
717	已经是冬天了，燕子回答说，这里很快就要下寒冷的雪了。	1
718	“事实上，你是我见过的人中最容易动情的。”	4
719	说真的，每当我想到我举足轻重的身份,我就感动得直掉泪。	1
720	That is the wonderful thing about it, but I am afraid you don't understand the poetry of life.	0
721	What a silly boy you are'! cried the Miller, I really don't know what is the use of sending you to school.	2
722	起初花儿苍白得像悬浮在河面上的薄雾一苍白得像早晨的纤脚，然后它变成了银白色，活像拂晓的双翼。	0
723	'Certainly,' cried little Hans, and he ran into the shed and dragged the plank out.	0
724	谢谢你，小燕子，王子说。	4
725	然而，圣栎树听明白了，觉得好难过,因他很喜欢这只在他的枝杈上筑窝的小夜莺。	1
726	Be happy, cried the Nightingale, be happy, you shall have your red rose.	0
727	这是美丽的德行，我这种德行可非一日之功。	0
728	我歌唱的东西，他受不了,我欢喜的东西，在他是痛苦。	2
729	'Quite full?' said little Hans, rather sorrowfully, for it was really a very big basket, and he knew that if he filled it he would have no flowers left for the market and he was very anxious to get his silver buttons back.	1
730	爆竹嘣嘣地回应着，快活得无以言表。	0
731	在高高的城市上空，一根顶天立地的柱子上站立着快乐王子的塑像。	0
732	国王的儿子要结婚，各种大庆小庆是少不了的。	0
733	All night long she sang, and the thorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her life-blood ebbed away from her.	1
734	我不希望争论,青蛙扬扬得意地说。	0
735	Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?	2
736	“我就住那儿去吧。”他叫道，“那是个好去处，新鲜空气有的是。”	0
737	But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by.	1
738	And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.	0
739	You see the winter was a very bad time for me, and I really had no money at all to buy bread with.	1
740	“早死净了。”转轮焰火念叨说，睡了过去。	1
741	So the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like water bubbling from a silver jar.	0
742	我肯定欢迎下一场，可这天很蓝，一丝云彩都没有。	1
743	“你完全是一个惹人生气的家伙，”火箭说，没有一点儿教养。	2
744	亲爰的王子，我必须离开你，可我永远不会忘记你，明年春天我会给你带回两颗美丽的宝石，安放在你忍痛割爱的那些地方。	1
745	于是她展开她那棕色的翅膀，直冲云霄。	0
746	And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black–haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.	0
747	“我的玫瑰是白色的，”玫瑰树回答道，白得像海浪的泡沫，甚至比山头的冰雪还要洁白。	0
748	They are certainly very lovely,' said Hans, and it is a most lucky thing for me that I have so many.	0
749	And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him.	1
750	山楂树的气昧甘甜扑鼻，藏身山谷的风铃草香气袭人，漫山遍野的杜鹃花芬芳四溢。	0
751	How well you talk'! said the Miller's Wife, pouring herself out a large glass of warm ale, really I feel quite drowsy. 	0
752	房子的一扇窗户开着，我从窗子看见一个女人坐在桌子前面。她的脸又瘦又憔悴，一双手红红的，很粗糙，被针扎 得到处是针眼儿，因为她是做针线的女工。	1
753	And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.	2
754	So little Hans worked away for the Miller, and the Miller said all kinds of beautiful things about friendship, which Hans took down in a note-book, and used to read over at night, for he was a very good scholar.	0
755	Alas! my son,' she cried, wilt thou not kiss me before I go?	1
756	But his companion answered him: 'Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.'	4
757	“很显然他们彼此真心相爱，”小侍童说，“如同水晶一样透亮清澈！”国王又下旨给他涨了一倍俸禄。	0
758	My roses are red, it answered, as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern.	0
759	给我个阴雨天儿让我呆在水沟里，我就很幸福了。	0
760	他整夜遥望星星,晨星亮起时他就高兴得叫唤一声，然后就悄无声息了。	0
761	真的，《宫廷报》称赞他是焰火艺术的最好范例呢。	0
762	'Ugh!' snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, 'this is perfectly monstrous weather.	2
763	“的确是悦耳的声音，”青蛙接着说，我希望你也到那鸭子水塘去吧。	0
764	于是，夜莺给圣栎树唱歌儿，她的声音好像水从银壶里泻岀来那样叮咚作响。	0
765	可他母亲只能给他白开水喝，于是他就委屈得哭啊哭啊。	1
766	'Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,' he answered.	4
767	She sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.	4
768	So the Star–Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak–tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.	0
769	他飞进了黑賤駿的小巷，看见挨饿的孩子面色惨白,无可奈何地望着黑乎乎的街道。	1
770	白天我和我的小伙伴儿在花园里玩耍，晩上我在大厅里领头跳舞。	0
771	 'Besides,' he used to say, 'he is going to give me his wheelbarrow, and that 'is an act of pure generosity.'	0
772	The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water.	0
773	如果他们失去了他们唯一的儿子,，非凡的火箭那说什么话也枉然。	1
774	And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare.	1
775	See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.	2
776	嘶嘶！嘶嘶！嘶嘶！他径直飞向了天。	0
777	It is quite remarkable how one good action always breeds another.	0
778	There is away, answered the Tree, "but it is so terrible that I dare not tell it to you."	3
779	Here at last is a true lover, said the Nightingale.	4
780	“给我一朵红玫瑰吧，”她尖声叫道，“我来给你唱我最动听的歌儿。”	0
781	“胡说八道！”大焰火筒说，浪漫情调从来不死。	2
782	“常识问题，一点不错！”火箭气呼呼地说，你忘了我这人很不平常，非常冒尖的。	2
783	玫瑰树顶端花枝上的那朵玫瑰花哟，开得仿佛一面银镜里的玫瑰花影,又好像水池里一朵玫瑰的倒影。	0
784	There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.	0
785	“啊嗨！啊嗨！”火箭生气地说。	2
786	“我毫不怀疑对你来说非常重要，”火箭回答说，“不过要是我愿意，我就会哭。”他还真的泪如泉涌，像雨珠儿一样顺着他的棍子往下流，差一点儿把两只小甲虫淹死,这两只小家伙正在琢磨一起修房盖屋,找一处干爽的地方躲避风雨。	1
787	Sweet is the scent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the valley, and the heather that blows on the hill.	0
788	“旧棍子！”火箭说，不可能！金棍子，这才是他应该叫的。	2
789	And the Squirrel answered, Thou hast slain mine.	2
790	But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star–Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold.	4
791	'Nay,' he cried, laughing, 'but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.'	0
792	那年轻的大学生还躺在草地上，和她飞走时看见的一样，他那双美丽的眼睛里的泪水还没干呢。	1
793	He is weeping for a red rose, said the Nightingale.	1
794	And the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the thorn.	3
795	So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.	0
796	哦，不管怎样还没有了泥地儿呢。	1
797	“一尊大塑像连一点雨都遮挡不了，它还有什么用？”他发问说，“我只好去找一个好烟囱去躲躲了。”他决定飞走算了。	2
798	至于我别总爱掉眼泪的冋题嘛，很显然在场的各位都根本不懂感情是怎么回事。	2
799	“我要飞往金字塔去了。再见吧！” 他说走就飞走了。	1
800	For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.	1
801	And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap, And the Hare said to him, Why art thou weeping?	1
802	'Thou speakest truly,' answered the Woodcutter, 'yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.'	1
803	Dear little Hans,' cried the Miller, I am in great trouble.	1
804	And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.	0
805	'Well, really, that is generous of you,' said little Hans, and his funny round face glowed all over with pleasure.	0
806	“好哇！好哇！”整个宫廷呼喊着,娇小的公主笑得十分开心。	0
807	The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.	0
808	But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.	1
809	Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, 'Tu–whit!Tu–whoo! Tu–whit! Tu–whoo! what delightful weather we are having!'	0
810	“我们饿得不行了！ ”他们叹道。	1
811	如果我给她带一朵红玫瑰去，我就可以把她揽在怀里，她会把头依偎在我的肩头，她的手会被我的手抓得紧紧的。	4
812	“一听你这话就知道你守着这乡下没见过世面，”火箭回答说，否则你是知道我的身世的。	2
813	But the girl frowned.	1
814	Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.	1
815	Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill–favoured, and make jest of them, and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.	0
816	“总得有听着的人呀，”青蛙回答说，我这人就喜欢一个劲儿说个没完。	0
817	这确实是一幕壮观的表演。	0
818	My dear friend, my best friend,' cried little Hans, you are welcome to all the flowers in my garden.	0
819	她不会钟情于我，我的心会碎的。	1
820	“秩序！秩序！”一个爆竹吆喝道。	2
821	But the Tree shook its head.	1
822	由于哭泣流泪，浑身湿透，火箭根本没法发力离去了。	1
823	So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon.	2
824	“这世上有人活得很幸福，我深感欣慰哪。”一个失望的人打量着这尊奇妙的塑像，喃喃自语道。	0
825	但是谁都没有听见他引爆了，就是两个近在咫尺的小男孩儿也没有听见，因为他们睡得很香了。	1
826	我的两只脚固定在这底座上了，我不能动啊。	1
827	不过我一想到他们也许会失去他们唯一的儿子，心里就非常非常难受。	1
828	Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: The fly is thy brother.	4
829	他内里最好的东西是火药，却让泪水弄得精湿，一点用场都派不上了。	1
830	这根本不是交谈。	2
831	砰！砰！焰火筒飞上了天空。	0
832	“啊！生活中高雅的事情，它们是多么美好啊！”鸭子说，“可这倒让我想到我饿得要命了她向溪流下面游去，一路“呱呱呱”叫个不停。	0
833	“你是我见过的最粗鲁的人，”火箭说，“你不理解我对王子的友谊。”	2
834	“我们现在有面包吃了！”他们欢呼说。	0
835	'How shall I thank thee?' said the Star–Child, 'for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.'	4
836	My roses are white, it answered, "as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain.	0
837	Therefore weep no more but be glad.	0
838	I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.	1
839	“我要让全世界刮目相看，兴奋一阵子,我要轰动一时，让所有的人一年之内不谈论别的事，就把我挂在嘴边。“	0
840	可是，她就是不和我跳舞，因为我没红玫瑰献给她，他有气无力地倒在草地上，把脸埋在两只手里,哭了。	1
841	And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,' and the Star–Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.'	4
842	I am very sorry,' said little Hans, rubbing his eyes and pulling off his night-cap, but I was so tired that I thought I would lie in bed for a little time, and listen to the birds singing.	1
843	And the Star–Child said to him, 'I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.'	3
844	随后，秋天来了，他们都飞走了。	1
845	“是不比乞丐强多少啊，”市议员们说。	1
846	And the Star–Child said to it, 'I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.'	3
847	'Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?' she asked. 'And is it not winter now?'	3
848	And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a haggard hard by, saw what the Star–Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: 'Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?'	2
849	And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.	1
850	I may be wrong, but I should have thought that friendship, true friendship, was quite free from selfishness of any kind.	4
851	I have got all my creepers to nail up, and all my flowers to water, and all my grass to roll.	0
852	“高兴起来吧，”夜莺尖声说，高兴起来吧,你会得到你的红玫瑰的。	0
853	And when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to the Rose-tree, and set her breast against the thorn.	1
854	But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.	1
855	“哎！我现在没有红宝石了。”王子说，我只有这双眼睛了。	1
856	“天怎么下起棍子雨了？”她赶紧跳进水里去了。	3
