1	你怎么对所有需要怜悯的人那样冷酷无情呢?	2
2	At last he lost his way, and wandered off on the moor, which was a very dangerous place, as it was full of deep holes, and there poor little Hans was drowned.	3
3	“你说这话是疯了，”星孩生气地大声说。	2
4	他们的羽毛让白霜冻得硬刷刷,但是他们一点儿也不在乎;他们滚动着他们的大黄眼睛，在森林里彼此遥相呼叫：“啯啯啯喵------啯啯!啯啯啯喵------啯啯！我们遇到了多么好的天气啊！”	0
5	I like hearing myself talk.	0
6	It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass. 	0
7	Its branches were all golden, and silver fruit hung down from them, and underneath it stood the little boy he had loved.	0
8	You are the rudest person I ever met, said the Rocket, "and you cannot understand my friendship for the Prince."	2
9	Only in the garden of the Selfish Giant it was still winter. 	1
10	Every afternoon, as they were coming from school, the children used to go and play in the Giant's garden. 	0
11	Travel improves the mind wonderfully, and does away with all one's prejudices.	0
12	就这样，星孩和樵夫的孩子一起抚养大了，同他们坐在同一张餐桌旁就餐，同他们一起玩耍。	0
13	于是他走过去，朝她扔石头，取笑她;那要饭女人眼睛里充满恐怖，看着他，而且是目不转睛地注视他。	3
14	Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful, said the Student angrily, and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the gutter, and a cart-wheel went over it.	2
15	“我们过得多么快乐幸福啊！ ”他们互相告慰道。	0
16	He had been to visit his friend the Cornish ogre, and had stayed with him for seven years.	4
17	他们玩耍了整整一天，天黑了他们才来和巨人道别。	0
18	I am very glad I have travelled.	0
19	“这是一个令人愉快的地方，”北风说，“我们一定要请冰雹来访冋。”	0
20	不公平瓜分了这世界，除了忧愁分得公平，什么东西都分得不公平。	2
21	但是他对他们说：我不配啊，因为我不认我的亲生母亲，在我找到她，求得她的原谅之前，我是不会心安的。	1
22	这世界的负重是任何一个人都承担不了的，这世界的悲哀也是任何一颗心都承受不了的啊。	1
23	因为花园里没有孩子们，鸟儿不愿意在里面唱歌，桃树也忘记开花了。	1
24	One morning the Giant was lying awake in bed when he heard some lovely music.	0
25	你一脸幸福哪。	0
26	快快滚到一边。	2
27	The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing. 	0
28	在花园最远的角落，一棵树开满了可爰的白花儿。	0
29	星孩哭了，低下头来，祈求上帝造就的万物原谅他，并继续在森林里行走，想决心找到那个要饭的女人。	1
30	可怜的孩子们这下没有地方可玩儿了。	1
31	但是他又严厉地和他们讲了一遍，说:“快把这些东西拿走，别让我看见他们。	2
32	最后他迷了路，在非常危险的沼泽地跌跌撞撞，不慎掉进了深窟窿里，可怜的小汉斯淹死了。	3
33	但是麻风病人一个劲儿求他，星孩终于动了恻隐之心，把那块白金送给了他。	4
34	星孩于是走向树林，花了整整一天时间搜寻那块黄金，但是怎么找也找不到。	1
35	那是一个冬天，入夜后天冷得更厉害了。	1
36	“春天把这花园遗忘了，”他们大叫着，“这下我们可以一年到头住在这里了。”	0
37	“可我如何报答你呢，”星孩说，“你瞧！这可是你第三次救我了啊！”	4
38	And the other children, when they saw that the Giant was not wicked any longer, came running back, and with them came the Spring.	0
39	这红宝石的心里有鲜血，这珍珠的心里是死亡。	3
40	务必把那块白金带来,要不你过不了这关，别忘了你是我的奴隶,我可是用一碗甜酒的价钱把你买来的。	3
41	商人虐待我们，我们必须对他们言听计从。	3
42	It was a lovely scene, only in one corner it was still winter.	0
43	Then he began to feel a curious tingling sensation all over him.	3
44	这时候，雕像里面响起一种奇怪的声音，好像有什么东西破碎了。	1
45	我根本不是你的儿子。	2
46	The Giant loved him the best because he had kissed him.	4
47	草地上到处长着美丽的鲜花，像星星一样；春天时节，花园里的十二棵桃树盛开耀眼夺目的粉红色花儿和银白色花儿；秋天来了，树上结满了累累果实。	0
48	So it was always Winter there, and the North Wind, and the Hail, and the Frost, and the Snow danced about through the trees.	1
49	不久，春天来了，乡间到处开满小小花朵，小鸟儿到处飞舞。	0
50	他马上脸色惨白，说：“为哪位国王？”	3
51	政府为什么连管也不管呢？	2
52	那是一个可爰的大花园，茸茸绿草满地都是。	0
53	And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star–Child, and drave him in front of him.	3
54	But the Tree shook its head.	1
55	And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, 'Eat,' and some brackish water in a cup and said, 'Drink,' and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain.	2
56	“亲爱的王子啊，”燕子说，“我不忍心干这个。”然后就开始哭起来。	1
57	“可是人家并没有失去他们唯一的儿子,”焰火筒说，“他们根本就没遇上倒霉的事。”	0
58	So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star–Child, and said to him, 'Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.'	4
59	比如说,假如今天夜里我有个三长两短，这对谁来说都是一大不幸！	1
60	So the Nightingale pressed closer against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a fierce pang of pain shot through her.	3
61	So the Star–Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.	0
62	那男孩儿在发烧，在床上来回翻身，他妈妈累得支撑不住，已经睡着了。	1
63	The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.	0
64	“我笑是因为我高兴呀。”爆竹回答说。	0
65	You will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together it will tell you how I love you.	4
66	一层薄薄的红晕岀现在玫瑰的叶子里，宛如新郎初吻新娘的柔唇时脸上露出的潮红。	4
67	I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.	2
68	But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has nipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I shall have no roses at all this year.	1
69	“这里好冷啊，”他说，“不过我会跟你呆上一个夜晚，给你当送信的人。”	4
70	可怜的人儿，失去了他们唯一的儿子！	1
71	But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, 'What is thy business in the city?'	2
72	但是冬天把我的叶脉冻坏了，霜冻摧毁了我的花蕾，暴风雨折断了我的树枝，今年我没法开玫瑰花了。	1
73	“浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了，浪漫这东西死了呀。”她小声嘟哝说。	1
74	他的朋友六个星期前都飞往埃及去了，但他耽搁下来，因他和最美丽的芦苇相爱了。	4
75	他当然是爆炸了。	3
76	Fainter and fainter grew her song, and she felt something choking her in her throat.	3
77	'Real friends should have everything in common,' the Miller used to say, and little Hans nodded and smiled, and felt very proud of having a friend with such noble ideas.	4
78	哦，再见,听我说没错，能跟你交谈我很高兴。	0
79	It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals.	0
80	Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress. 	3
81	I am afraid it will not go with my dress, she answered, "and, besides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels, and everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers."	3
82	“这是再自私不过的理由，”火箭生气地说，	2
83	“尽管我不认识他，我天天夜里都给他唱歌,天天夜里我把他的故事讲给星星听，现在我看见他了。	4
84	他来到大教堂的大门口时，士兵纷纷横出矛戦，说：“你到这里乱闯什么？只有国王才能从这里进去。	2
85	朝臣这下全乐了，有人索性冲他大声喊：“陛下，人民在等待自己的国王，你却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒火顿生，说：“他为我们国家带来耻辱,不配做我们的一国之君。”	2
86	星孩于是跟兔子说：“我正在寻找一块白金，到处找也找不到，要是我不把白金带给我的主人，他会打我的。”	3
87	God made the blind–worm and the mole, and each has its place.	4
88	你必须给我唱歌，胸脯顶在一根玫瑰树刺上。	3
89	“不，小燕子，”可怜的王子说，“你一定要飞往埃及去。”	1
90	“谁竟敢伤害你？”巨人大声责问道，“快告诉我，看我拿上我的大剑，去把他砍了。”	2
91	教士乘车而过，捻珠祈祷，谁都不关心我们。	1
92	Why doesn’t the Government look to it?'	2
93	And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.	1
94	发现自己这么受人欢迎，真是令人再高兴不过了。”	0
95	However, they did not seem to have much effect.	1
96	So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold.	0
97	我倒觉得更像星星，它们一放起来你就明白了，像我吹笛子一样赏心悦目。	0
98	And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, 'What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?	4
99	What a success I am!"	0
100	And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, 'If to–day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.'	3
101	All that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for Love is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier than Power, though he is mighty.	4
102	The fact is that I find this place rather tedious.	1
103	王子看见新娘时，跪下一条腿，吻了新娘的手。	4
104	She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break."	1
105	按宫廷御医说，那个生下他的白人姑娘是死于悲伤或瘟疫；而另有人则说是用一杯配制好的意大利烈性毒酒让她服下，不到一小时就活活弄死了她;那个可靠的信差，把这孩子放在鞍子前面就跑了，等他跳下疲劳的马、敲开牧羊人小屋的柴门时，公主的尸体正在往挖开的墓穴里放。	3
106	多么可怕的灾难！	3
107	Indeed, I know of nothing in the world that is either nobler or rarer than a devoted friendship."	0
108	然而，夜莺的声音却越来越弱了，她的小翅膀开始扑棱，她的眼睛蒙上了一层阴影。	1
109	It is a beautiful virtue, and I possess it in a high degree.	0
110	你还一心想杀死你的妈妈不成？”	2
111	再往远处,在一片果园里，一只夜莺在欢唱。	0
112	He spoke with a very slow, distinct voice, as if he was dictating his memoirs, and always looked over the shoulder of the person to whom he was talking.	4
113	But the little boy whom the Giant loved was never seen again.	1
114	What a terrible misfortune! 	3
115	In the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.	1
116	我们今后怎么养活他呢？她生丈夫的气了。	2
117	星孩听了这话又一次对他大发慈悲，把那块红色的金子白送了他，说：“你比我更需要它。”	4
118	And how shall we tend it?' And she was wroth against him.	2
119	这下我能写完我的剧本了。”他看上去相当幸福。	0
120	And the Mole answered, 'Thou hast blinded mine eyes.	2
121	闲人莫入，违者法办	3
122	Ahem! ahem! said the Rocket angrily.	2
123	If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.'	3
124	Order! order! cried out a Cracker.	2
125	第二天，魔术师来到他跟前，说:“今天你要是不把那块黄金给我带来，那我肯定要把你当奴隶使唤，抽你三百鞭子。”	3
126	那是花园最远的角落,一个小男孩儿正站在那里。	1
127	'Dear little Hans,' said the Miller, 'would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?'	3
128	燕子把一片又一片赤金送给穷人，他们的孩子脸上有了红润，在大街上欢声笑语一片，玩耍得很痛快。	0
129	Hans,' said the Miller, 'friendship never forgets.	4
130	“我要一直跟你在一起。”燕子说,随后就在王子脚边睡着了。	4
131	She is like a white rose! they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies.	0
132	But the children said that they did not know where he lived, and had never seen him before; and the Giant felt very sad.	1
133	Your picture was beautiful, he murmured, "but you are more beautiful than your picture"; and the little Princess blushed.	0
134	他重重地摔进了浪头里，他的伙伴赶快得得得跑走了。	1
